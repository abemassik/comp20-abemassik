Important question: I opened index.html using multiple browers, and am left 
        somewhat confused.When I opened it in Firefox the content loaded, but when I opened it in chrome, opera, and safari it did not work. It makes sense to me that it would not work, because it may be considered a cross origin request, getting files from my computer. I just do not understand why it works for firefox. Accessing from the heroku source works because the heroku site allows cross domain requests.
